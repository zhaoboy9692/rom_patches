Subject: [PATCH] build: Always use release-keys

* [@techyminati]
  - Some payment/banking apps check for this and report device as rooted, I know this is dirty hack,
    the proper fix should be signing builds , but since most of developers dont care about signing builds
    lets hardcode 'release-keys' here.
